# Streamlit Crime Data Visualization Project

## Overview

This project provides an interactive web application for visualizing crime data. Users can explore crime statistics for different years and categories of offenses. The application utilizes Streamlit, a Python library for building web applications, and Plotly for creating interactive visualizations.

## Getting Started

To run this Streamlit app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download the crime data files (`Offenses_Involving_Weapon_Use_Off_Cat_by_Type_of_Weapon_Force_Involved_2021.xlsx` and `Offenses_Involving_Weapon_Use_Off_Cat_by_Type_of_Weapon_Force_Involved_2022.xlsx`) and place them in the same directory as the script.
4. Run the Streamlit app by executing the command `streamlit run app.py` in your terminal.

## Usage

Once the Streamlit app is running, follow these steps to explore the crime data:

1. Select the year you would like to explore from the dropdown menu.
2. Choose the type of data you want to visualize (offenses committed or weapons used).
3. View the displayed data and interact with the visualizations.

## Running the Application

To run the application locally, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required dependencies using the following command:

pip install streamlit pandas plotly

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application by executing the Python script containing the code provided.
